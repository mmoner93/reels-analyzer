Mini app "Instagram Reel Processor"

Backend – Python based
- REST API service
- Handles asynchronous processing pipelines

Required features:
* API:
  - add a new processing task (Instagram reel URL)
  - get task status
    - pending / in progress / completed / failed / cancelled / processing
  - cancel a task
  - retrieve text transcript

* Processing pipeline:
  - download reel video using an external online service
  - extract audio track from the video
  - generate text from audio using a speech-to-text service
  - each step must be executed asynchronously

* Concurrent execution
  - multiple tasks must be processed in parallel
  - no blocking calls on the main request thread


Frontend – Web based
- Simple UI (any JS framework or plain JS)
- Web pages
  - tasks list page
  - tasks result page (or just a popup over tasks list)
  - add task page or dialog

Bonus Requirements
- Text analysis
  - detect the language of the generated text
  - extract key topics from the transcript
- Workflow engine
  - use a workflow / pipeline engine or library
- User management
  - add authentication (login)
  - each user has isolated processing tasks
  - users can only see and manage their own tasks
- Error handling
  - invalid or unavailable Reel URLs
  - external service failures
  - partial pipeline failures


Deliverable
- Python backend project
- Frontend project
- Very simple how-to (txt / md format)
  - how to run backend
  - how to run frontend
  - description of the processing pipeline
